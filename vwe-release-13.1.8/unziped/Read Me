Operators Console************************************************************Version 1.5.11¥	Modified for compilation with THINK 7.0.4.¥	Expanded vehicle constants to make room for more vehicle types.Version 1.5.12¥	Added the creation of a Mission Log file. The mission log tracks statistical data on actual missions launched.¥	Added a toggle to "Skip Mission Review" (command F). This toggle is to be used for training missions where a Mission Review is not wanted. This toggle resets itself to "off" after each mission.¥	The "Stop Game" command has been given a command key equivalent (command I). Also, this command will not be enabled until 30 seconds into the game to insure that the vehicles are out of the elevators thus preventing a game crash.¥	The Console has been built with a "noFail" - "noDebug" version of the Arcnet Library. This will fix the "unimplemented trap" error when a debugger was not installed and the game network produced an error.¥	The BattleTech team list has been modified to allow typing abbreviations for BattleTech teams and colours (i.e. Kurita Red = "KR").
